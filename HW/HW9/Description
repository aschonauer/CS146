The function find lowestCommonAncestor finds the common ancestor of 2 nodes 
closest to the nodes in a BST. It takes in the root node and the 2 nodes and 
then uses recursion to go down the tree and while the 2 nodes are both in
the same direction (either both greater or both less than the current node)
Once the node either is the current node or the 2 nodes are in different
directions it returns the current node back through the recursion.

The way I tested it was taking in user inputs to create the BST and then 
choosing which ones will be the 2 nodes to find the lowest common ancestor.
