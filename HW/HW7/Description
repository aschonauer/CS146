minMeetingRooms is a function used to figure out the number of servers needed given
an amount of time intervals.

First the List/Array is sorted based on the first number in the intervals making sure
to keep the intervals in pairs together. This lets us see if the starting value is
going to overlap into the previous interval if it does, it increments the amount of 
servers needed to run all of the jobs (Starting value is 1). If there are no
intervals then it just returns 0.
