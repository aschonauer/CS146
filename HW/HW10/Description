The function levelOrder takes in the root of the tree and returns 
a list of nodes sorted by each level of the tree. 

I implemented this by first returning an empty list if there is no
root node. And if there is a tree then it adds the value of the root
to a list which is added to the list of levels in the tree since the
root is always on its own level. Then I created another list containing
just the root which while this list has a node in it then it will repeat
the following steps:
  for every node in the list it will pop it, and then add its child
  nodes to itself. The new nodes' values are added to  a list of values
  which is then added to the level list. All of these child nodes will
  be on the same level since when starting at the root you are creating
  a list going down the tree popping one at a time since at the start
  the list will have nodes of the same level since it always appends
  the next level using the children nodes.
