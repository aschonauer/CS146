To find the unique integer triplets that sum up to 0 in the array
it is important to check every combination without repeating the same
indexes.
To do this I created nested for loops where the outer one goes through
every element but stops 2 short of the end to allow for the other 2 
indexes to be there at the end. The middle for loop goes through the array
always starting one above the first loop, and the last loop goes through
the array starting one above the middle loop. Looping through the array 
in this way will test every combination of triplets in the array without
duplicating indexes. 
Another thing that we wanted to watch out for was not duplicating triplets.
To avoid this I created an if statement to see if the sorted triplet is not
in the new triplet array before adding it.
