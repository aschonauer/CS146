The function LongestPalindrome takes in a string, splits it
into an array of letters, sorts it, then for every letter
it checks using a nested for loop if there are two of the same
letter it adds them to the beginning and end of a list or arraylist called pal
which makes the letters in the array of letters null so that they can
not be used again. At the end it takes the first letter that is not
null and adds it into the middle of the list and then breaks out 
and then returns the size of the palindrome created by the list pal.
