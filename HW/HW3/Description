INSERTION SORT:
This method goes through every element in the array (for loop) and if it is smaller
than the one ahead of it it will move towards the front (while loop). If the list is
already sorted, then it will only go through the for loop. The for loop by itself
is O(N), so O(N) is the time complexity for the best-case scenario.
The worst case and average case goes through and moves all of the elements in the list.
Making the complexity O(N^2)

MATRIX_MULTIPLICATION:
In matrix multiplication there is a nested for loop inside of a nested for loop. 
No matter what, it will go through each element in the loop. So, the best-case,
worst-case, and average-case are all the same. Because the for loops go through
a set amount of columns/rows each by itself is N, and N*N*N = N^3.
