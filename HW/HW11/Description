The function floodFill takes in a 2d array of integers which
represent pixels in an image and fills a potion determined by
the row (sr) and column (sc) all of the same color pixels
next to the targeted one will be changed to the given color.

I implemented this function recursively. If given an invalid 
row or column number the function will return the original 
image. Then it saves the color of the target pixel (original
color) and then changes the color of the pixel to the new
color. Then it will check each pixel in the 4 directions to
see if it is the original color, if it is then it will recurse
to change that color and move around from there. At the end
of the function it returns the changed image.
