Given n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and finding the first bad version using 
the given API isBadVersion(version) which returns whether the version is bad.

First ask for user input of versions (n).
Use binary search methods to find the first bad version.
Instead of returning the first bad that is found, it will go
until settling on the first bad using an if else statement to
figure out if we should go up in the version list or go down.
Once low is greater than high it will exit the search and print out
the bad version.
