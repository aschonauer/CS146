The function findTheCity finds the city with the least
neighbors within a given distance. It is implemented using
a Floyd Warshall algorithm which finds every route from every
node and keeps the shortest paths saved into an array of
various distances. It uses 3 for loops to find every route.

After that algorithm it takes each distance less or equal to
the threshold and increments the amount of neighbors to that
specific city. Then it finds which has the least amount of 
neighbors and then returns that city.
