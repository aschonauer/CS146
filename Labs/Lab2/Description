This code will take in 2 words and test if they are anagrams of each other.

First it takes away any spaces in the words/phrases.
Then it splits the words into 2 arrays of characters. 
Then it sorts each of these arrays in alphabetical order.
Then it compares the two arrays to see if they are equal.
If they are equal then they are anagrams of each other, and if not they are not anagrams.
