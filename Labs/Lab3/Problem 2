Creating asymtotic notation for:

isPrime(n):                     //c1
  for(i = 2, i*i <= n; i++) {   //
    if(n % i == 0) {
      return false
    }
  return true

1. Best Case: n is < 4 and skips the for loop and returns true
2. Worst Case: n is >= 4 and is a prime number, goes through the for loop maximum # of times
3. Average Case: n is >= 4 and goes through the for loop

Best Case: O(1), Ω(1), then θ(1)

Worst/Average Case:
O(): 
Ω(): 
θ():
