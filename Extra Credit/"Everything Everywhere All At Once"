1 Given an adjacency list, how can you convert it to an adjacency matrix? 
  - The first index of the adjacency list is the first row of the matrix and so on.
    From there each column also represents all the indexes and the value at each spot
    becomes True if the element of the row shares an edge with that element and False
    if not. So what we have to do is just go through each index of the list, make
    a matrix where the rows and columns are the elements in the list and then find for
    each value in the matrix if there are edges connecting each element to others.
